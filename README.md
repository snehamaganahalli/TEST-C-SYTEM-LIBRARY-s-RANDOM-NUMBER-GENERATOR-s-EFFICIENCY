# TEST-C-SYTEM-LIBRARY-s-RANDOM-NUMBER-GENERATOR-s-EFFICIENCY
TEST C SYTEM LIBRARY's RANDOM NUMBER GENERATOR's EFFICIENCY


How to sync the code?
1)  Please execute the below command

 git clone https://github.com/snehamaganahalli/TEST-C-SYTEM-LIBRARY-s-RANDOM-NUMBER-GENERATOR-s-EFFICIENCY.git


2) How to compile the code

 gcc random_test.c -lm

3) How to execute

 ./a.out 1000

The above command will try to find the efficiency of the system library's Random Number Generator on 1000 samples.
You get the value of PI (3.142) on the screen. If the value of PI is 3.142 or approximately equal to it, then your library's Random number generator is good.


The above program gives pi value = 3.142 for the greater samples (1000 or 2000).
